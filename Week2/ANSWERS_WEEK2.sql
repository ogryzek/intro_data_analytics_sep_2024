Question 9
*/
/*
Answer:
There is a difference in the average price list price when there are items
of the same color whose price list price is 0.

This should be checked with the business entity, 
but if there is an error in the data, and the price list price equal to 0 is incorrect, 
then it disrupts and lowers the average significantly.

For our data, since there is no real business factor we can consult, 
we can assume that there are no products whose price per customer is 0, 
so we will filter these lines out
